# Willow Bot (Facebook Chat Bot) 🤖

Facebook chat bot, built using the MS Bot Framework and MS QnA Maker.

It was built over the course of a day (~10 hours), for a charity _hackathon_ event (in aid of [Willow Burn Hospice](https://willow-burn.co.uk/)).

The idea was to build a bot that could handle common questions and answers, freeing up the time of employees and volunteers.

I'm putting the code up here as a reference - maybe it'll be useful for somebody.
